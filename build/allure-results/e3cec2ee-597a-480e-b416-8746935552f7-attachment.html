It may take several minutes before the sugar begins to melt. Without stirring, watch the sugar closely as it begins to liquefy at the edges.  It will slowly turn from a yellow to a golden and finally to a brown caramel sauce.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When the liquefied sugar is turning from golden to brown, immediately remove the saucepan from the heat. Watch carefully!  (If you miss this point, the sugar will quickly turn too dark and you will have to start all over again).  Immediately pour liquid caramel into 6 3-1/2 inch ramekins and swirl to cover bottom evenly. The caramel hardens rapidly, so work quickly.  Set aside.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For flan:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place 2 inches of water on the bottom portion of steamer.  Cover and allow water to come to a boil.  In the meantime, heat milk and sugar in a saucepan until just warmed and sugar has dissolved.  Whisk eggs and vanilla in a large bowl until blended.  Slowly pour warmed milk into the eggs, beating until well combined.  Scoop off foam and discard.  Ladle into prepared ramekins and place into steamer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turn down heat  this is very important  to medium and steam for 15 minutes.  Remove and allow to cool.  Once cool, cover and refrigerate overnight.  When ready to serve, carefully run a knife around the inside each ramekin to loosen the flan. Place a plate on top of the flan and invert until flan pops out.  Serve with sliced strawberries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&quot;,
